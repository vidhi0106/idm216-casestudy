    <h1>The overview</h1>
    <p>In this project we created a responsive web based application for a foodtruck called Tyson Bees. 
        The problem was that the foodtruck did not have any way for the customers to place an order online or 
        in advance so we created this app to facilitate ordering online from the food truck. We carried out 
        multiple usability testings with low fidelity wireframes to test out the features and map out the experience, 
        high fidelity designs to get more feedback on the aesthetics and finally, we tested our final website to get 
        feedback on the final functionality of the application. All of these usability test sessions helped us make 
        informed design and development decisions to provide the best user experience. Through our usability 
        tests we realized that we did not need a filter button for the menu and that people preferred a simplistic 
        design with an app flow that was clean and had minimal clicks.</p>
